# Web scraping pipeline (AiCore training)

Web scraping pipeline I'm working on as part of my 'AI and data engineering' training at [AiCore](https://www.theaicore.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=new-broad&utm_term=classification&utm_source=google&utm_medium=ppc&utm_campaign=UK-Brand&utm_term=ai%20core&utm_content=621263672281&hsa_acc=7296592433&hsa_cam=13050226730&hsa_grp=146850559851&hsa_ad=621263672281&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=kwd-453580118074&hsa_kw=ai%20core&hsa_mt=e&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gclid=Cj0KCQjwj7CZBhDHARIsAPPWv3cRHYGa6UYh2t0kFM_4r7C6QAXdB4IMha25Y77p7wcgt712S5vymj4aAq8xEALw_wcB). Despite me being quite confident coding in Python, this is my first ever webscraping experience, therefore all technologies and tools mentioned throughout are being learned from scratch, one at a time ü§Ø

## üèÖ Goals of the project üèÖ

The requirements for this data collection pipeline are to:

- develop a module that scrapes data from various sources using Selenium and Requests;

- curate a database with information about the chosen website and store it on an AWS RDS database using SQLAlchemy and PostgreSQL;

- perform unit testing and integration testing on the application to ensure that the package published to Pypi works as expected;

- use Docker to containerise the application and deploy it to an EC2 instance;

- set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to push a new Docker image;

- monitor the container using Prometheus and create dashboards to visualise those metrics using Grafana.

## Milestones 1-2: Environment setup and choice of website to scrape

The project is being completed using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as a code editor, plus Git and GitHub for version control. The environment setup was done by creating a new environment, `web-scraping`, in conda. Once every required package had been installed, a `requirements.txt` file was generated.

The choice of website to scrape was based on two main criteria: personal interest, and learning opportunities. Being a real estate enthusiast, my choice fell rather naturally on [RightMove](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/). Quite luckily, the website is challenging to scrape and offers plenty of opportunities to learn HTML tricks. Additionally, it stores data in rigorous fashion, thus making it a pleasure to scrape and create a database out of.

Given that the website includes thousands of properties for sale and rent located throughout the United Kingdom, I decided to reduce the scope of my project to only include properties for sale in a 10-mile radius from Cambridge, as shown in the image below.

## Milestone 3: Find links to the pages from which we wish to scrape data

The project is written in Python and utilises OOP concepts throughout. In this milestone, I created a `Scraper()` class within a `scraper.py` file and started to populate it with methods intended to create a list of the properties featured on the first page of my research, and then extract the links of each one of these and store them in a dedicated list. The `main.py` file, which runs the code, includes what follows:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    bot = Scraper()
    bot.bypass_cookies()

    while bot.page <2: # use while True when scraping all pages
        bot.get_all_property_links()
        bot.create_global_list()
        bot.scroll_to_bottom()
        bot.move_to_the_next_page()
```

`if __name__ == '__main__':` assigns the scraper to the `bot` variable. First, the scraper bypasses cookies - `try-except` is used in the `bypass_cookies` to make sure the programme doesn't crash in the absence of cookies to accept. The scraper then performs all actions from the methods in `scraper.py`, until all properties in all web pages into consideration have been found. This is done using a while-loop.

The scraper includes a crawler. The first action performed by the scraper after accepting the cookies is indeed that of finding all properties on the page, and then all the links to said properties. These are stored in dedicated lists, and then added to a `all_properties_links` which is extended with all extracted elements (properties and their links) from all pages. The first property on the property list from each page is always a 'featured property' and is therefore systematically sliced out.

Once a page has been scraped, the scraper moves to the bottom of it and clicks on the 'next page' botton. `try-except` syntax is used to ensure that the programme doesn't crash when there is no more 'next page' button. The condition in the while-loop ensures that the code is only run and tested only on the first two pages for now.

Meaningful messages are printed throughout at this stage. Additionally, the program utilises numerous 
`time.sleep(2)` methods to make sure the website does not recognise it as a bot and block our IP address. All methods are set as private because they are only accessed within the Scraper() class.
## Milestone 4: Retreive data from details page

In this milestone, I created a method called `extract_the_data_into_a_dictionary()` which loops through the `all_properties_links` list and creates dictionaries that map pre-determined keys (labels) to values extracted from a link. The dictionaries are then systematically appended to the end of the `properties_dict_list` list. The dictionaries have the structure thet follows:

```python
properties_dictionary = {'ID': , 'UUID': , 'Image': , 'Price': , 'Address': , 'Type': , 'Bedrooms':, 'Description': }
```

 The value associated to the 'Image' key here is the url associated to the property floorplan. The actual image is downloaded later in the class using a `download_image()` method that loops though the dictionaries for each property, names the images as 'image_+imagenumber+.jpg', and stores them locally.

At this point, the code still contains numerous prints and unnecessary comments, which will be stripped from it at refactoring, i.e., in the next milestone. Nonetheless, the code works in a satisfactory way and all required tasks are performed correctly, including the creation of a .json file to store all data retrieved by the scraper.

The most important takeaways of this milestone where the correct implementation of while loops (ouch!) and choice of relative xpaths to extract content from the page. I also learnt how to download images locally and to create a .json file from a list of dictionaries using the `json.dump()` method to store data locally.
