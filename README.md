## Goals üèÖ

Data Collection Pipeline
Developed a module that scraped data from various sources using Selenium (and maybe Requests) 
Curated a database with information about the website and stored it on an AWS RDS database using SQLAlchemy and PostgreSQL
Performed unit testing and integration testing on the application to ensure that the package published to Pypi is working as expected
Used Docker to containerise the application and deployed it to an EC2 instance
Set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to push a new Docker image
Monitored the container using Prometheus and created dashboards to visualise those metrics using Grafana

## Milestones 1-2: Environment setup and choice of website to scrape

## Milestone 3: Find links to the pages from which we wish to scrape data
