The house offers a blend of spacious accommodation, uncompromising quality and restored period features.\n\nWith tree-lined grounds of around 3.50 acres, the house enjoys a peaceful rural setting, boasting a stunning brickwork exterior and bespoke sash windows fitted throughout, displaying elegant craftsmanship.\n\nImmediately, as you enter the private driveway, you will notice the air-conditioned triple door garage with separate office, alongside a generously sized self-contained annex and another large office with a high ceiling and exposed beams.\n\nThe main house is arranged over three floors of living accommodation, offering just over 4,700 square feet. You are greeted with a huge country-style kitchen including a full size Aga cooker, leading into the bespoke conservatory which looks out onto the rear courtyard-style garden. Adjoining the conservatory, you will find a separate utility room. Next to the rear garden is a detached air-conditioned leisure barn complete with bi-folding doors and a separate wet room.\n\nThe main living room offers a stunning fireplace and a beautiful bay window overlooking the grounds. The charming front elevation is south facing meaning you will enjoy sunlight throughout the entire day. Through the entrance hall, you will find the library with bespoke shelving and an exposed brick fireplace. You will also find a large separate dining room with French doors leading to the side patio where you\u2019re met with one of two ponds. This feeds the irrigation system for the rear garden.\n\nThe reception rooms boast a plethora of period features and wood burning stoves along with a well-appointed wine cellar. With multiple office spaces and multi-purpose rooms, this home offers a tranquil space for those wanting to work from home.\n\nThe first floor has its own sitting area and four very generously sized bedrooms, each with its own en-suite facilities. The principal bedroom includes a freestanding slipper bath. The top floor has a further three bedrooms with original features, views onto the grounds and a separate family bathroom.\n\nThe current owners have run a very successful 5* Bed & Breakfast and hosted multiple wedding receptions. It quickly moved up the ranks to become one of the highest-rated Cambridgeshire B&B's on Tripadvisor. There is a separate wing with its own entrance consisting of 3 bedrooms, making this the perfect home for those looking to benefit from an additional income stream. The B&B has welcomed guests from all over the globe; individuals, couples, business executives and families alike, meaning a successful B&B in this area has the opportunity to achieve upwards of \u00a375k per year with plenty of room for uplift.\n\n\nSeller Insight\n\n\u201cWe bought the property in January 2003 but didn\u2019t move in until the following November as we had to carry out a mammoth renovation project. We updated everything from the electrics and plumbing to the kitchen and bathrooms, all the plaster was stripped off the walls, all joists were pulled out and as the stairs had fully collapsed we had them beautifully remade. We\u2019ve enhanced the property further by adding a triple garage and office with air-con and heating, a bespoke hand-made conservatory, a large separate gym building complete with air-con and heating. We also enlarged the kitchen reinstating the old well within the new extension and converted the stable into a beautiful one-bedroom self-contained annex.\"\n\n\u201cThe house really comes alive when it\u2019s filled with family and friends. The grounds have also provided a wonderful backdrop to countless alfresco get-togethers, and a great place to relax, particularly while catching the evening sunsets\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe standout room is possibly the kitchen \u2013 we have a kitchen table that seats ten and a gorgeous Aga which creates a warm and welcoming atmosphere. We love to host dinner parties and the kitchen is the perfect place for entertaining.\u201d\n\n\u201cSeventeen years ago, we set up a B&B as the house has a separate front staircase leading to three en-suite bedrooms. We\u2019ve also had five weddings in the garden with marquees and caterers for guests, we\u2019ve held countless big birthday and wedding parties for our families. We also held a charity ball here for over 170 guests to raise vital funds for the Cambridge Children\u2019s Hospice - it\u2019s a property that has endless possibilities.\u201d\n\n\nLocation\n\nKnapwell is a beautiful village just 10 miles from the city of Cambridge and approx. 6 miles from St Ives. Locally, you will discover a variety of retail, well-regarded pubs, restaurants and leisure facilities including a spa and golf club. A short stroll will take you to Knapwell Woods where you will see a display of bluebells in early spring and a fantastic place for family adventures.\n\nSchools\n\nFor families, Knapwell is a short distance from Elsworth primary school, Swavesey Village College & Cambourne Village College (both Ofsted rated \u201coutstanding\u201d) alongside a number of highly-rated independent schools in Cambridge for all age groups. The Perse School and Hills Road Sixth Form College (one of the top performing state sixth forms in the UK) are just 10 miles away.\n\nTravel\n\nWith excellent links to London and the North, St Neots train station is just a 15-minute drive, whilst there is easy access to the A1/M11 for direct links to London and Stansted Airport. Madingley Park & Ride is also a short drive away, offering easy access into central Cambridge.\n\nEast-West Rail is considering a number of proposals for a rail link between Bedford and Cambridge. They consulted on five route options in 2019. If approved, they aim to begin construction in 2025. One of the options could include a brand new train station in Cambourne, less than a 5 min drive from Knapwell, providing quicker and cheaper connections to science parks, universities and industry.\n\n\n\nAdditional Information\n\nPlanning permission has been granted to convert the neighbouring barns into a small number of high-end commercial offices that will be in keeping with the surroundings (not included within the sale of Knapwell Wood Farm).

It occupies a quiet and secluded position on Madingley Road, in the western section of the Conservation Area of Cambridge, and extends to over 2,460 sq ft. The internal living space follows a single storey L-shaped plan designed around an internal south-facing garden with a rare Liquidambar tree at its centre. The design takes an exacting approach to light and space, with a focus on natural materials and energy efficiency to support sustainable modes of modern living.\n\nThe Architect\n\nThe celebrated architect Meredith Bowles founded Mole Architects in 1996. The practice has received numerous awards for its innovative approach to design, including the highly prestigious RIBA Manser Medal (2004) for Meredith\u2019s own home which was deemed the best one-off house by an architect in the UK. This particular house won two RIBA awards in 2012, for its exceptional sustainability and \u2018Spirit of Ingenuity\u2019. Meredith lectures widely and is active in promoting sustainable design.\n\nThe Tour\n\nThe house is set back from Madingley Road, amongst an area of tree-filled gardens on the western edge of Cambridge. It is uniquely concealed behind a brick gatehouse extension, which houses a workshop and garage that provides private off-street parking. Designed around a number of existing trees protected by a tree preservation order, displacement pile foundations were chosen to create minimum disturbance to the roots.\n\nThe house was constructed using a timber frame, with clay blocks providing thermal mass, glulam beams supporting the roof space and a series of integrated ambient energy sources ensuring excellent energy efficiency. Rainwater is harvested and stored in a tank underground, solar panels are used for hot water supply and the underfloor heating is generated from a ground source heat pump. There is also mechanical ventilation with a heat recovery system and low energy lighting fitted throughout. External \u2018green walls\u2019 are combined with timber cladding and insulated with hemp inside wood fibre panels for breathability. A green sedum roof spans the easterly wing for additional insulation and biodiversity.\n\nThe primary entrance leads directly into a single south-facing corridor that provides circulation to all areas, while retaining a direct visual connection to the garden from every room. The kitchen and dining room are arranged in an open-plan layout, with sliding glass doors opening the entire space onto the internal courtyard. There is an interconnected utility space and pantry store, and a study positioned adjacently. The arterial corridor features deep bay windows which provide a lovely, quiet spot for reading or enjoying the view with a morning coffee; they could even be used as sleeping areas for visiting children.\n\nThe three bedrooms are beautifully proportioned; each has an excellent provision of built-in storage and views onto hidden courtyards. Two of the bedrooms have direct access to the garden. The main bedroom has a large en suite bathroom, with a garden view from the bath through a strategically placed low letterbox window. A family bathroom is flanked by the two other bedrooms and has a cleverly conceived mirrored skylight overhead, which frames a view of the Liquidambar tree.\n\nThe beautifully light, open-plan living space is located on the westerly wing of the house, where a large log-burner forms a natural focal point to the room. A ribbon of clerestory glazing and a wall of timber-framed glass walls invite an exceptional quality of natural light to flood through; in the summer months, the entire space can be opened onto the garden.\n\nOutdoor Space\n\nThe outside space is an immersive celebration of local wildlife, rich in biodiversity and teeming with flora and fauna; ducks make daily visits, as do plenty of birds, 19 species of butterflies, newts and dragonflies, which are drawn to the nature pond. There is an additional garden studio that offers excellent flexibility of use, easily befitting an additional home workspace, music studio or overflow accommodation.\n\nThe Area\n\nThe house can be found on Madingley Road on the westerly side of Cambridge, around 20 minutes\u2019 walk from the centre and conveniently located near many of the university buildings. Although the city is relatively intimate in scale, it has a superb selection of shops, dining opportunities and cultural events, with Kettles Yard and The Fitzwilliam Museum notable highlights.\n\nThere are plenty of green open spaces within easy reach and delightful walking routes towards the River Cam, with Granchester meadows offering opportunities for wild swimming. Cambridge is world-renowned for its university and the quality of its historic architecture, yet is also increasingly recognised as an international business hub, thanks to its growing technology and science industries.\n\nA direct train service runs from Cambridge to London St Pancras in approximately 50 minutes. Extensive intercity bus services also operate within minutes walk from the house. The motorway network is also easily accessed, with the M11 around one and a half miles away.\nShow less"}, {"ID": "property_12", "UUID": "8934b143-3271-497d-81e8-56f8afab4e28", "Image": "https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/127382792#/floorplan?activePlan=1&channel=RES_BUY", "Price": "\u00a32,500,000", "Address": "Maids Causeway, Cambridge", "Type": "Detached", "Bedrooms": "NONE", "Description": "Property description\nA unique opportunity to purchase a substantial grade II listed classic regency townhouse part of Charles Humphrey's Dolls House development, offering well proportioned and versatile accommodation extending to about 3175sqft.

Both the dining room and drawing room enjoy elegant proportions and fireplaces with the sitting room also boasting French doors to the south facing garden room with mature vine and access to a large terrace.

Nearby St. Ives offers further amenities including a guided bus to historic Cambridge while London can be reached by Huntingdon Train Station.\n\nSeller Insight\n\n\u201cRiver House is rich in history and has been home to some notable people of interest, including Walter Dendy Sadler who was a founding member of our local regatta and one of the first artists acquired by Henry Tate for his collection of paintings. Lt. Col. Hayward followed (1923 \u2013 1943) during which time he donated the playing field to the village, followed by the Glyn banking family (1943 \u2013 1976) and then us,\u201d say the owners.\n\n\u201cBeing a local boy, I had always known of the exceptional position and fine Georgian architecture of River House with its enclosed garden, riverside access, and thatched boathouse. It\u2019s a true family home that is light and spacious, yet welcoming and cosy. We were fortunate enough to acquire it in 1976.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have an award-winning restaurant/pub, good village shop and Post Office within easy walking distance, as well as circular river walks, bike riding opportunities, and public access for fishing and water sports. We enjoy easy access to the North Norfolk coast, Cambridge, and Huntingdon which offers frequent trains to London. We have a thriving sports and social club, sports facilities, children\u2019s sports days, and the annual regatta that has been held since 1904. Groups are wide and varied and our well-attended Church has community rooms and a caf\u00e9.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur garden is enclosed and has lawns, herbaceous borders, and a natural area. We are surrounded by trees, including beech, oak, and a very old mulberry tree. The Studio has allowed for two wedding receptions where we seated 76 guests and has played host to music recitals and large family gatherings. We can easily accommodate a marquee in the garden where we have held breakfast parties, jazz evenings, village society events, and special birthdays with hog roasts and so on.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor him, the green panelled room with its open fire on a crisp, cold day or evening is the best place to spend time gazing up river, perhaps with a glass in hand, whilst for her, it\u2019s those peaceful moments curled up on the sofa close to the AGA in the kitchen with a book in hand. This has been a lovely house to live in and it\u2019s been a very happy home. Aesthetically very pleasing with spacious, bright rooms, and views over the river from all the bedrooms. We\u2019re going to miss it when we leave, especially the beautiful garden, but it\u2019s time for us to downsize and for a new family to fill the house and enjoy everything it has to offer.\u201d\n\nVillage information\n\nThe Hemingfords (Hemingford Grey and Hemingford Abbots) are situated along the banks of the River Great Ouse and are well-known as very picturesque and sought-after Cambridgeshire villages with beautiful river walks and footpaths to St Ives. Much of the villages are within a Conservation Area with many thatched cottages and barns and other architecturally important buildings, including the Grade I Norman Manor House in Hemingford Grey and the Grade I listed church in Hemingford Abbots.\n\nHemingford Grey has a wide range of facilities including the Award winning \u201cCock\u201d pub, village shop \u201cBudgens\u201d, Post Office, children\u2019s play area, 12th Century church, Church hall, Coffee shop, Primary school, Pavilion sports club with facilities for tennis, squash, cricket, football, bowls and a variety of social clubs and activities.\n\nThe sister village, Hemingford Abbots, also has the \u201cAxe & Compass\u201d pub, an all purpose-built Village Hall, playing field equipped with children\u2019s play equipment and a golf range/course.
